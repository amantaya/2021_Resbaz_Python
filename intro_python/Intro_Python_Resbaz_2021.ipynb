    "    *   This is convention, not a requirement.\n",
    "*   It's common to write them using a text editor but we are going to use a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "*   There is a bit of extra setup, but it is well worth it because Jupyter Notebooks provide code completion\n",
    "    and other helpful features such as markdown integration. This means you can take notes in this notebook while we are working throughout the session.\n",
    "*   There are some pitfalls that can also cause confusion if we are unaware of them. While code generally runs from top to bottom, a Jupyter Notebook allows you to run items out of sequence. The order of code blocks running order will appear as a number to the left of the code text field.\n",

    "        instructions.\n",
    "*   It also installs all the extra libraries it needs to run.\n",
    "*   Once you have installed Python and the Jupyter Notebook requirements, open a shell and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   This will start a Jupyter Notebook server and open your default web browser. \n",
    "*   The server runs locally on your machine only and does not use an internet connection.\n",
    "*   The server sends messages to your browser.\n",
    "*   The server does the work and the web browser renders the notebook.\n",
    "*   You can type code into the browser and see the result when the web page talks to the server.\n",
    "*   This has several advantages:\n",
    "\t- You can easily type, edit, and copy and paste blocks of code.\n",
    "\t- Tab completion allows you to easily access the names of things you are \n",
    "    using and learn more about them.\n",
    "\t- It allows you to annotate your code with links, different sized text, bullets, \n",
    "    etc to make it more accessible to you and your collaborators.\n",
    "\t- It allows you to display figures next to the code that produces them to \n",
